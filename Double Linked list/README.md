## Insertion

- Insertion involves adding a new node to the list.
- There are three types of insertion:
    - Insertion at the beginning: The new node is added at the start of the list.
    - Insertion at the end: The new node is added at the end of the list.
    - Insertion at a specific position: The new node is added at a specified position in the list.  



 ## Deletion

- Deletion involves removing a node from the list.
- There are two types of deletion:
    - Deletion by value: The node with the specified value is removed.
    - Deletion by position: The node at the specified position is removed.

## Reverse

- Reverse involves reversing the order of the nodes in the list.
- The list is traversed from the beginning to the end, and each node's next pointer is updated to point to the previous node.  

## Length

- Length involves calculating the number of nodes in the list.
- The list is traversed from the beginning to the end, and a counter is incremented for each node.
